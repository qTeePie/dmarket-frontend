# Kitz Universe ‚Äì Minimal On-Chain NFT Marketplace üê±‚Äçüë§‚ú®

This is a simple, minimalistic NFT marketplace built entirely from scratch ‚Äì including smart contracts and frontend.  
The goal of this project is to create a fully on-chain, clean, cyberpunk-inspired platform to display, buy, and sell NFTs.

> **Note:** This project is still a work in progress. The core functionality is being prioritized first ‚Äî styling and advanced features will be improved in later versions.

- On-chain ERC721 contract
- Dynamic NFT fetching (on-chain metadata)
- Display NFTs in a clean gallery
- Individual NFT page with collection name + metadata
- Basic Buy button (functionality coming soon)

## üéØ Why this project?

This project is built for learning and to demonstrate:

- Clean folder structure (Atomic Design + Features-based)
- Full on-chain interaction (no backend database)
- Real-world use of ethers.js, Next.js App Router, and Foundry

## üöß What's missing / coming next

- Buy & Sell functionality
- User wallet connection
- Full UI/UX polish
- Tests & security hardening

## ü§ç Disclaimer

This is a learning project and still under development.
It‚Äôs intentionally kept **simple and clean** rather than over-engineered.
Focus is on **understanding the full stack of NFT marketplaces, from Solidity to React.**

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
